Welcome to Stream Tool's documentation!
=======================================

**Stream Tool** is a Python library for building a website of macros.

Use Stream Tool to create macros to control OBS or other programs
on your computer. Or literally to run any python code you
want to on a button press.

There is currently built-in functionality to run control some basic parts
of OBS and to send your own OBS websocket requests. Other
functionality may be added in the future but the other main feature is
that a function can be created and attached to a button to run it.
